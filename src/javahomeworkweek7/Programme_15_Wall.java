/**
 * 15. Wall Area
 * Write a class with the name Wall. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width
 * and height of type double.
 * The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg
 * constructor). The second constructor has parameters width and height of type double and it needs to
 * initialize the fields. In case the width is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the
 * height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
